## Tutorial on GMMs

This code was used in the blog post ["What is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) - 3D Point Cloud Classification Primer"](https://wp.me/p8QHD6-9Z). 

It is composed of three main parts:

* Generating data
* Fitting the Gaussian Mixture Model
* Visualization

### Installation
You will need to have `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` and ofcourse `numpy` installed. 

The code was tested on Python 3.5.2 on Windows. 
### Usage
Simply run `estimate_gmm_sklearn.py`. 
Change the variable `D` to be 2 or 3 for 2D or 3D results respectively.
